# Introduction

As automated attack techniques rapidly advance, CAPTCHAs remain a critical defense mechanism against malicious bots. However, existing CAPTCHA schemes encompass a diverse range of modalities‚Äîfrom static distorted text and obfuscated images to interactive clicks, sliding puzzles, and logic-based questions‚Äîyet the community still lacks a unified, large-scale, multimodal benchmark to rigorously evaluate their security robustness. To address this gap, we introduce MCA-Bench, a comprehensive and reproducible benchmarking suite that integrates heterogeneous CAPTCHA types into a single evaluation protocol. Leveraging a shared vision‚Äìlanguage model backbone, we fine-tune specialized cracking agents for each CAPTCHA category, enabling consistent, cross-modal assessments. Extensive experiments reveal that MCA-Bench effectively maps the vulnerability spectrum of modern CAPTCHA designs under varied attack settings, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîoffers the first quantitative analysis of how challenge complexity, interaction depth, and model solvability interrelate. Based on these findings, we propose three actionable design principles and identify key open challenges, laying the groundwork for systematic CAPTCHA hardening, fair benchmarking, and broader community collaboration.

# Performance

- **MCA-Bench**: the first large-scale, cross-modal CAPTCHA attack benchmark with 20 real tasks.  
- **Proposed** a unified evaluation pipeline with a single pass-rate metric and open source scripts.  
- **First** full-scale CAPTCHA security assessment with guidance for human‚Äìmachine verification.
